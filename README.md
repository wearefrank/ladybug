Ladybug debug- and test tool by WeAreFrank!
===========================================

Ladybug, developed and maintained by the integration company WeAreFrank!, adds message based debugging and message based
unit testing, system testing and regression testing to your Java application. Call Ladybug at certain checkpoints in
your code (either directly or using AOP) to generate tree based reports. Implement a rerun method to be able to rerun
reports and optionally stub certain checkpoints for regression testing.

Ladybug online demo
===================

To see Ladybug in action as part of the Frank!Framework go to:

- https://frank2example.frankframework.org/iaf/gui/#/testing/ladybug

And in Open ZaakBrug as part of http://demodam.nl:

- https://open-zaakbrug.demodam.nl/debug


How to use Ladybug
==================

Ladybug is incorporated into the Frank!Framework and as such documented as part of the Frank!Manual. For a quick
introduction to Ladybug, read:

- https://frank-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator/ladybug.html

For a detailed explanation please read (which will also explain the use of Ladybug as a test tool):

- https://frank-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/ladybug/ladybug.html


How to incorporate Ladybug into your application or framework
=============================================================

There are two main area's to consider, the actual logging/debugging of business logic and the configuration/integration
of Ladybug into your project.

The first and most interesting area is the actual logging/debugging of business logic. This is similar to code that you
write for logging. When we look at the following code in the ZGWClient.java of the Open ZaakBrug we can see that the
Debugger (a wrapper around the Ladybug TestTool class) is initialized in the same way as a normal Logger. Logging the
json for the POST is also similar except that the debugger will return an object (which a logger doesn't). This is
because the user of the Ladybug GUI can decide to stub a checkpoint in which case the Ladybug will return a different
json than it got as a parameter value. Every startpoint (which will make the tree indent one level) must have a
corresponding endpoint (to make the indent go back one level). In this case the endpoint is using a Lambda function so
that in case of stubbing not only the Ladybug will return a different value but it will also skip the actual code of
doing a post to another system (which at the time of running a test might not be connected and would give an error).
Other than using Lambda's adding checkpoint statements are pretty straight forward an similar to using a traditional
logger.

```
	private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());
	private static final Debugger debug = Debugger.getDebugger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());
	...
	json = debug.startpoint(debugName, json);
	url = debug.inputpoint("url", url);
	log.debug("POST: " + url + ", json: " + json);
	...
	String zgwResponse = (String) debug.endpoint(debugName, () -> {
			...
			String response = this.restTemplateService.getRestTemplate().postForObject(finalUrl, entity, String.class);
			...
			return response;
		});
```

The second area to consider while integrating Ladybug into your project is the Spring configuration and enabling of the
servlets needed to serve the Ladybug frontend. This can basically be done in two ways (direct and using 
[AOP](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/core.html#spring-core)). We hope that the
following examples for both methods are enough to get you running. If not, don't hesitate to [contact us](#feedback) for
help.

Direct integration of the Ladybug has been done in the Ladybug test webapp:

- https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-test-webapp

The Quarkus application to demo and test Ladybug:

- https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-quarkus

And the Open ZaakBrug:

- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug

The first two project do not contain many files, so you can easily look at all the files and get an idea of how Ladybug
has been integrated. The [next section](#how-to-change-and-test-ladybug) describes how to run the Ladybug test webapp.
For the Open ZaakBrug the most important files to look at are:

- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/blob/master/src/main/java/nl/haarlem/translations/zdstozgw/Application.java
- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring-ladybug.xml
- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/tree/master/src/main/java/nl/haarlem/translations/zdstozgw/debug
- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/blob/master/src/main/java/nl/haarlem/translations/zdstozgw/controller/SoapController.java
- https://github.com/Sudwest-Fryslan/OpenZaakBrug/blob/master/src/main/java/nl/haarlem/translations/zdstozgw/translation/zgw/client/ZGWClient.java

The Frank!Framework is using AOP to integrate the Ladybug, see the Ladybug module of the Frank!Framework:

- https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/tree/master/ladybug

And the AOP related spring configuration xml:

- https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/blob/master/ladybug/src/main/resources/springIbisDebuggerAdvice.xml

The [next section](#how-to-change-and-test-ladybug) also describes how to run Ladybug with the Frank!Framework.


How to change and test Ladybug
==============================

General setup
-------------

Clone the following projects to your Git folder or any other folder of your choice:

- https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug (backend code) (the project you are currently looking at)
- https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-frontend (frontend code, not needed when making backend changes)
- https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-test-webapp (webapp to test Ladybug)
- https://github.com/wearefrank/frank-runner (building and running the test webapp with Ladybug)
- https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework (in case you want to test your Ladybug changes with the Frank!Framework)

Create skip-replace-inject.txt in checkout directory of the ladybug project. You do not have to give it any contents. If you want to understand the purpose of this file, then see `pom.xml`.

Backend development
-------------------

Read the Frank!Runner [README.md](https://github.com/wearefrank/frank-runner#frankrunner) to learn how to integrate it
with your IDE but you can also just start the restart.bat in the frank-runner/specials/ladybug folder. This should
build and run the test webapp with Ladybug. When Tomcat has been started by the Frank!Runner browse to:

- http://localhost

This should display a page with links to the various resources available like the Ladybug frontend and API.

To speed up the build copy build-example.properties in this folder to build.properties and enable the relevant
properties as describes in the comments in this file.

You can also enable spring.profiles.active=storage.file to use the file storage and see the reports generated by the
unit tests of the ladybug project in the Ladybug GUI.

Testing backend changes with Frank!Framework
--------------------------------------------

To test your Ladybug changes with the Frank!Framework enable test.with.iaf=true. By default, it will test with the webapp
module of the Frank!Framework. This can be changed with the iaf.module property. The frank-runner/specials folder
contains a folder per module that can have it's own build.properties with custom properties (see the build.xml for
possible values).

Frontend development
--------------------

Please do the following to set up your development environment for the front-end:
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), choose version 20. You should get executables `npm` version 10.x and `node` version 20.x. Check these versions using `npm -v` and `node -v`.
* Change directory to your checkout of ladybug-frontend.
* The Node Package Manager (npm) includes another package manager, yarn. We use that one because it is more stable. Enable it by executing the command `corepack enable`. You should do this in a command prompt that runs with administrator permissions.
* Use `yarn -v` to check that you have the right version of yarn. The version you are using should equal the version that is asked in `package.json`. In `package.json` you have a line like: `"packageManager": "yarn@x.x.x"`.
* Run `yarn install --immutable` to install your dependencies. The flag ensures that you get exactly the same dependencies as the other developers have. If you want to include a new dependency, update `package.json` and do `yarn install`. File `yarn.lock` will be updated, the list of all dependencies including dependencies of other dependencies. Check in `yarn.lock` to ensure that other developers will update to the same dependencies as you. If it is not your intention to introduce a new dependency, then do not check-in `yarn.lock`!. If you made an error with these installation instructions, you may have unwanted updates of the file.
* In case you don't have a direct internet connection you might need to set HTTPS_PROXY, see https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/proxy-configuration.
* Run `yarn prepare` to prepare Git hooks. If you do not do this, you will not be able to commit or push in the ladybug-frontend project.

Testing frontend changes with the test webapp
---------------------------------------------

* Start the backend using `frank-runner/specials/ladybug` as explained at [Backend development](#backend-development). Wait until Tomcat is up and running.
* Execute command `ng serve` from within the `ladybug-frontend` checkout. This wil make Node.js serve the Ladybug frontend files and proxy the Ladybug backend api as the src folder contains a proxy.conf.json (this will circumvent CORS related problems as the frontend served by Node.js on port 4200 would call the api on port 80). It is now possible to use both the WebJars packaged Ladybug frontend and the Ladybug frontend served by Node.js. The page on the following url (also mentioned above) contains links to both frontends: `http://localhost`.

Testing frontend changes with Frank!Framework
---------------------------------------------

The Frank!Framework incorporates Ladybug and configures is a bit different then the test webapp. It for example adds a Gray box view which you might want to test. The Frank!Framework serves the Ladybug on a different url then the test webapp so you need to configure the previously mentioned proxy a bit different and change the url in src/proxy.conf.json from http://localhost/ladybug to http://localhost/iaf/ladybug. In case you also have backend changes you can start the Frank!Framework as eplained above (with test.with.iaf=true). Otherwise it is easier to for example run Frank2Example1. See the Frank!Runner [README.md](https://github.com/wearefrank/frank-runner#frankrunner) for more information on how to start a Frank2Example1 or another Frank.

Testing frontend changes with unit tests
----------------------------------------

To run the unit tests of the frontend, run the following command:

```
ng test
```

At the time of writing, there are no unit tests but there are end-to-end tests.

End-to-end testing is done using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Cypress is a dependency configured in `package.json`, so it should have been installed when you did `yarn install --immutable`. You have the following options for running the tests:
* `yarn run e2e`. This runs the end-to-end tests headless and without user interaction.
* `yarn run e2e-interactive`. This opens a Window from which you can choose what tests to start. You can select the webbrowser you want to test with.

In case nothing happens after "Compiled successfully" you might need to run `set HTTP_PROXY=` to prevent Cypress from connecting to locahost using your
proxy.

When the tests are running, you will see the ladybug GUI. The GUI will show the effects of the commands that are applied by the tests.

Quarkus
=====
To see how to run the backend for Quarkus, please see [Quarkus backend](https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-quarkus#demo-and-test-ladybug-in-quarkus).\
For the frontend, do the following:
 - Check out of the branch [Quarkus configuration](https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-frontend/tree/quarkus-configuration)
 - Run `ng serve --open` or run `ng serve` and navigate to [localhost/ladybug](http://localhost/ladybug/)
 - NOTE: It is important to note that running a report in the test tab is not yet possible with Quarkus

Create and publish NPM package and WebJar
========================================

### Prerequisites
- Make sure the latest changes are committed (and preferably pushed) to the project
- Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder (so `PATH/TO/ladybug`)
- If this is the first time, you need to log into NPM
    - Create an account on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if you don't have one yet.
    - Ask a colleague to add your account to the WeAreFrank! organization.
    - In the terminal run the following command `npm login`, which prompts you to log into NPM.

### Creating and publishing an NPM package
- Run the command `yarn install --immutable`, to sync with changes done by others
- Run the command `ng build`, to build the current project
- In the `dist/ladybug/index.html` change the types of the three scripts on line 14 to `application/javascript` (so `type="module"` -> `type="application/javascript"`). The specific scripts are:
  - `runtime.e3a101410a4894ca.js`
  - `polyfills.42dedf2fcdca615b.js`
  - `main.134a36bdfc8f0ad9.js`
- In the copied `package.json` (`dist/ladybug/package.json`) do the following:
  - Remove the contents of `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
  - Update the `prepare` script to be `cd ../.. && husky install`
- Navigate to `dist/ladybug` in your terminal
- Run the following commands in order:
  - `npm publish`
  - `git tag vX.Y.Z`, with X.Y.Z being the latest version of the package, which you can find in your `package.json` (for example `0.0.12`)
  - `git push origin vX.Y.Z`, with X.Y.Z being the version you just specified.
    - When Chrome cannot be started because the binary is not found: set CHROME_BIN=C:\\...\\chrome.exe (in Git bash: export CHROME_BIN=C:\\\\...\\\\chrome.exe)
    - When Chrome cannot be started (two attempts are done by the command), shut down Chrome (in which probably two tabs have been opened)
- You have now successfully published the NPM package, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wearefrank/ladybug

### Creating and publishing WebJar
- Navigate to [WebJars](https://webjars.org)
- Click on the `Add a WebJar` button
- Select the type `NPM`
- As package name, type in: `@wearefrank/ladybug`
- Select the correct version
- Click on the `Deploy` button to deploy the WebJar. Wait for the Deploy Log to finish (there should be a `Deployed!` somewhere).
- You have now published the WebJar, see (after a few hours) https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/webjars/npm/wearefrank__ladybug/

### Prepare for next cycle
- Go into the file `ladybug-frontend/package.json` and increment the version number (for example `0.0.12` -> `0.0.13`)
- Commit and push the changes in `ladybug-frontend/package.json`, with the commit message `Set version to X.Y.Z for the next development cycle`

CI/CD
=====

The preceding sections explained how to change Ladybug. This section explains the CI/CD of Ladybug, and it explains how we manage releases.

First remember that ladybug is the main project. Project ladybug-frontend is a dependency of ladybug. The frontend version referenced by ladybug is specified by the ladybug `pom.xml` file. It is the value of property `frontend.version`. This property contains a version number that references a WebJar, see [Create and publish NPM package and WebJar](#create-and-publish-npm-package-and-webjar) about creating a WebJar from project ladybug-frontend. This way, a release of ladybug comes down to releasing the combination of ladybug and ladybug-frontend.

WeAreFrank! has two automatic tests for Ladybug. First, our on-premise servers run a Jenkins test. This test checks the build of the ladybug project, in particular the master branch. Second, there is a GitHub actions test that lives in the ladybug-frontend project. This test does integration tests that exercise the Ladybug front-end. It has been implemented using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The test checks out ladybug-frontend, ladybug, the Frank!Runner and ladybug-test-webapp. Using these checkout directories, Ladybug can be started using the Frank!Runner and its script `specials/ladybug/restart.sh`, see [How to change and test Ladybug](#how-to-change-and-test-ladybug).

The Cypress test is used in two ways. First, it can be triggered if ladybug is updated. Project ladybug has a GitHub action that triggers the Cypress test of the front-end. This can happen because the Cypress test can be triggered by a `workflow_dispatch` event, see [test script](.github/workflows/start-frontend-test.yml). In this scenario, the following four inputs are provided:

* frontendCommitToCheckout: ladybug-frontend commit to checkout, typically a reference to a tag.
* backendCommitToCheckout: ladybug commit to checkout, typically a branch name.
* useRealFrontend: `true`, because we do not want to use the checkout of ladybug-frontend, but the WebJar contained in ladybug.
* mergeMasterToBranch: `true`, for the backend directs the test to merge the master into the checkout. This way, a pull request of the backend is emulated.

This scenario does not work on forks of the ladybug project. A fork does not have rights to trigger tests within the `wearefrank/ladybug-frontend` project. A commit on `wearefrank/ladybug` triggers the front-end test. GitHub will not show the success or failure of the front-end test. Please browse to https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-frontend and go to "Actions". Check the latest test run there.

The second use of the Cypress test is testing the front-end. The Cypress test is triggered by every commit and every pull request update of the ladybug-frontend project. The input arguments are not set, causing the new commit (or merge commit for a PR) to be checked out for ladybug-frontend. For ladybug the master is checked out. Input `useRealFrontend` is undefined, which is equivalent to `false`. This means that the front-end comes from the checkout of ladybug-frontend; the WebJar inside ladybug is ignored. Finally, `mergeMasterToBranch` is undefined (`false`). This scenario also works on forks of `ladybug-frontend`.

Here is how to use the CI/CD of Ladybug:

### Update the backend only

After a push on project `wearefrank/ladybug`, open https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug-frontend and go to "Actions". Check the success or failure state of the latest GitHub action. The test exercises the front-end that is referenced by the backend, an integration test. The test logs which WebJar version of the front-end is used and what branch of the backend; please check these to see whether the test run corresponds to your commit.

When the master of wearefrank/ladybug has been changed, check the success or failure of our Jenkins test that runs on an on-premise server. That test checks the build of project ladybug.

### Update the front-end

When updating the front-end, work on a branch that is allowed to live on a fork of the ladybug-frontend project. The Cypress test is executed for every commit. If you turn your work into a pull request, the success or failure status of the Cypress test will be shown in the pull request. As long as the updated front-end code is not referenced by the ladybug project, it is not part of Ladybug.

### Update front-end and backend

Update the front-end and the backend simultaneously on your development PC. The front-end changes will fail in CI/CD because they are tested against the master of the backend. Rely on the Cypress test on your development PC and on the Maven build of ladybug to test your work. When you trust your work, release the front-end in a WebJar as explained in [Create and publish NPM package and WebJar](#create-and-publish-npm-package-and-webjar). Please note that the released commit may live on another branch than master. Ensure that the commit and the tag are pushed to GitHub project wearefrank/ladybug-frontend. Then update `pom.xml` of ladybug to reference the new WebJar; do so on a branch pushed to wearefrank/ladybug. This update of the backend triggers the GitHub actions front-end test as explained earlier. Check that the latest run of the front-end test succeeds.

At this point, you can merge your work on ladybug to its master branch. After this merge, additional pushes on your ladybug-frontend branch will succeed in CI/CD because the corresponding backend changes are in the backend master. You can merge your front-end changes to master if the GitHub actions test succeeds.
